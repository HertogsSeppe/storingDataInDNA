The first argument against age-based rationing, is that it is in conflict with the value of fairness. The value fairness, in its most basic principle, is being seen and treated as equal, no matter the race, gender, religion, etc. (Frank, 2022) That is for the reasons that these factors that are things that can’t be controlled by the person in question and should therefore not be used as reasoning for certain issues like health care rationing. Age is in the same non-controllable category as for example a person’s race or religion. Using this as a proxy for rationing suggests that keeping the elderly alive is less important or less helpful than keeping the youth alive, insinuating that an older life is less valuable than a young one. This discrimination is unfair, as every human contributes to society in their own way and has their own inherent dignity. (Etzioni, 1998) While people in their mid-forties may work 5 days a week and help the economy by circling a lot of money around by earning and spending, the elderly frequently help in household tasks or take care of their grandchildren. Additionally, older people tend to volunteer, often working in schools, charities, religious institutions and many other communities. (Giordano, 2005) This shows that people of old age, contrary to earlier beliefs, are indeed valuable to our society in their own way, and should by no means be viewed as a bother. Therefore, the denying of health care based solely on their age is not in line with the principles of justice and should not be a tool to increase the budget of the government.
